Previous lesson: Factory Functions and Module Patterns
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern

- Describe variable scope and the difference between local and global context
- Understand and utilize closures effectively: [still a doozy]
- Identify drawbakcs of traditional constructor functions
- Implement factory functions to create objects in a clean and flexible way
- Use private variables and functions to encapsulate state
- Understand the module pattern and IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- Leverage encapsulation and namespacing to keep code tidy and collision free.
